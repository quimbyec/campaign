# What is this repo?
This is the home of TTRPG notes from a homegame group. The material available here is meant for the players to help guide their understanding of the world and their characters within it. Our sessions are not streamed anywhere, so these notes will likely not be helpful to the public. The repo is public because we are utilizing Github Pages to host the notes.
