This page is under construction, but in the coming weeks expect to see most (if not all) of the following: 
* Links to Lore with a Capital L
* Plans for a long term Daggerheart campaign (credit to Darrington Press and Critical Role. I'm not trying to claim any kind of ownership here, just trying to make a wiki for my players ðŸ™‚)
* Some kind of filing system for it all
* Updated theming (thanks Quartz 4.0 team for getting me started)
* Other things as they come up. Clearly, this is super thought out and well planned
