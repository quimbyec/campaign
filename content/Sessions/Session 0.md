## Important Notes from the Creators
In Daggerheart, players all take turns speaking at the table, describing what your characters do, the consequences of those actions, and how the narrative evolves because of those consequences. When the rules call for it, or when a situation demands, you’ll roll the dice to see what happens next. Depending on the result of those dice, the dynamics of the conversation will change.

There is no winning or losing in Daggerheart, in the traditional “gaming” sense. The experience is a collaborative storytelling effort between everyone at the table.
